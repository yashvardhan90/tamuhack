This example is just meant to get you started and show you a little of what's
possible with GitHub Pages. In just 3 simple steps, you will have your own
website.

1. [Create a Github account](https://github.com/join)
2. [Fork this repository](https://github.com/steveortiz/tamuhack/fork)
3. Edit the `_config.yml` file

{% highlight yaml %}
title: Hack on GitHub Pages
description: >
  This site will get you started hacking with GitHub Pages.
baseurl: "/tamuhack" # the subpath of your site
url: "https://yashvardhan90.github.io"
email: yashvardhan@tamu.edu
github_username:  yashvardhan90
linkedin_username: yashvardhansharma
twitter_username: yashvardhan90
{% endhighlight %}

That's it! You should now have a website of your own.

https://`your github username`.github.io/tamuhack/

There's so much more you can do with GitHub Pages, so don't stop here.
Explore the code in this project and start making it your own.
Continue on to the [Resources]({{ "/resources" | prepend: site.baseurl }})
section to learn more about GitHub Pages and other handy tools.

If you have questions, please look for me at the hackathon. I am here to help!
